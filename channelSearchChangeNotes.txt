channel search input changes:

<input>: id channelSearchInput removed and replaced by
	 class channelSearchInput

the button was removed. the trigger for channel search will 
now have to be on submit of the input form
how to target:
$('.channelSearchInput').submit(function(event){
	event.preventDefault(); //this is to prevent page refresh
	//any other thing that would happen on channel search click
});

I also made changes in main.js at line 134:
	instead of 'click', the function handles
	'submit' now
	and the '.channelSearchButton' was removed
	from jquery selector

the dynamic search bar creator thing at the bottom of the
script is commented out
